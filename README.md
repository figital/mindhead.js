Demonstration scripts and "protodemos" of EEG Neurofeedback using HTML5.

Demo-One is a self-contained folder and is desgined to provide a common visual starting point for discussion among practitioners of both neurofeedback and HTML5

Just load it up in the latest version of something like Google Chrome. The fake demo feed currently requires PHP but will soon be in Javascript.
