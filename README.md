mindhead will use bossk: https://github.com/figital/bossk

Demonstration scripts and "protodemos" of EEG Neurofeedback using HTML5.

Trello Project Board: https://trello.com/board/mindhead-js/4e9700ebd9cc1c00000130ac

Demo-One is a self-contained folder and is desgined to provide a common visual starting point for discussion among practitioners of both neurofeedback and HTML5..

Just load it up in the latest version of something like Google Chrome. The fake demo feed currently requires PHP but will soon be in Javascript.
